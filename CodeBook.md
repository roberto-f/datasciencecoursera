Tidy_dataset variables
======================

Starting from the dataset described at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
 the tidy dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The variables in the data set are:

"activity"
Activity in descriptive values.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

"subject" 
Subject id that do the test 

Mean values (for each activity/subject) of the mean and standard deviation measures.
The name of the columns are simply derived from the original names removing the special character.
Only the colums with mean or std values are considered from the original columns.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Every "mean" variables is the mean of the mean obtained by every activity/subject.
Every "std" is the mean of the std obtained by every activity/subject
